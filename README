#   This is the Conservatory archive of the wmctrl, a Unix command-line      #
#   tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM-compatible X Window Manager.         #
#                                                                            #
#   wmctrl is free software (open source software), written by Tomas Styblo  #
#   with contributions from others.  http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/ is  #
#   its home page.                                                           #
#                                                                            #
#   Because wmctrl does not appear to have any publicly accessible version   #
#   control repository, we've created this Conservatory Git repository.      #
#   We're not sure if Tomas Styblo or any of the other contributors are      #
#   are currently accepting bug reports, but if you run into a bug you       #
#   could try reporting it upstream and see what happens.  (As of this       #
#   writing on 2018-09-08, the latest wmctrl release was in January 2005.)   #
#                                                                            #
#   About the Conservatory and its copy of wmctrl:                           #
#   ----------------------------------------------                           #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For wmctrl, we started  #
#   from http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/dist/wmctrl-1.07.tar.gz and      #
#   then deduced the names of the previous releases.  We have committed      #
#   each upstream release as one git revision, starting from 1.00, using     #
#   https://github.com/Conservatory/conservatory.github.io/blob/master/\     #
#   conservatory-import and the upstream ChangeLog to automate the process.  #
#                                                                            #
#   There are other version-controlled copies of wmctrl on the Internet.     #
#   We found at least these two, and there may be others:                    #
#                                                                            #
#     * https://github.com/geekless/wmctrl                                   #
#                                                                            #
#       Adds -Y (iconify) and -S (sort in stacking order) options.           #
#       Also backports some 64-bit-data fixes from a Debian patch.           #
#                                                                            #
#     * https://github.com/dancor/wmctrl                                     #
#                                                                            #
#       Adds -j (list current desktop), -z (lower window),                   #
#       and some other interesting new options.                              #
#                                                                            #
#   Those two started from a top-skim of wmctrl 1.07, though, so they don't  #
#   preserve the full upstream release history.  It'd be nice if someone     #
#   were to clone this Conservatory copy and then re-port the enhancements   #
#   from those other repositories to create a canonical new wmctrl release.  #
#                                                                            #
#   In the meantime, this README is the only file we've changed from what's  #
#   in upstream, and the only change we made was to add this note.  Below    #
#   is the original content of the README file.                              #
#                                                                            #

wmctrl
A command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.

To compile and install the program, run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    (become root)
    make install


After installation you may run "wmctrl -h" to view the documentation.


The program is based on the EWMH specification:

    http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/

Please note that wmctrl only works with window managers which implement
this specification.

I recommend you to check out Zenity, which is an excellent 
tool to integrate the GUI and the command line.
